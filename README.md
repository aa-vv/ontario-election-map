# Ontario General Election Map - 2018

This little package creates an interactive map for 2018 Ontario General Election with R.

The map is colored by the winning party. Party that wins at a higher percentage gets a more intense color and vice versa. You can click any riding district to check the details which contain all running parties of that district with their candidates, votes and percentage.

## Dependency

You need to install the following dependencies in R to run the code. Some may require parent packages to be installed. Make sure you get the latest version of these packages to create the map properly.

* tools
* gdata
* dplyr
* rgdal
* maptools
* gpclib
* leaflet

## Integration

The codes can be run within Rstudio to generate a map which can be further exported as html. The html file can be modified or integrated in any website. Here is [an example](https://www.aaronique.com/works/archive/r/2018/10/03/ontario-election-map-2018.html) from my personal blog.
